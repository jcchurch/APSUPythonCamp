# APSUPythonCamp

Here's our Thursday plan.

- First Period (Pre Game Block)
    - First, let's learn about [Lists](Lists.md).
    - Second, talk about how you'd write a program to evaluate five dice in a game of Yahtzee!
        - Suppose you are given five numbers, where each number was random generated from 1 to 6.
        - How would you tell if all of the numbers were the same?
        - How would you tell if you have a three of a kind?
        - How would you tell if you have a four of a kind?
        - How would you tell if you have a small straight?
        - How would you tell if you have a full house?
        - How would you tell if you have a large straight?
    - Third, write the code for the **FiveDice** program.
    - Fourth, add on to the program.
        - Get the program to detect a full house. A full house is when you have three of one number and 2 of another number.
            - Hint: Extend the code for three of a kind to also check if the remaining numbers match.
        - Get the program to detect a large straight. A large straight is when the smallest die is a one and the largest is five OR the smallest die is a two the largest is six.
        - Get the program to detect a small straight. These are all of the small straight configurations:
            - 1, 2, 3, 4 (Will always be the first four value.)
            - 2, 3, 4, 5 (Could be first or last four values. This is the tricky one.)
            - 3, 4, 5, 6 (Will always be the last four values.)
- Second Period (Pre Lunch Block)
    - Review how lists work.
    - Teach the students (again) how to find the largest value in a list.
    - Ask the students to write a function which will return the largest value in a list.
    - Write the code for the Turtle Racing game.
    - Ask the students to extend the code.
        - Add more colors to the list.
        - Ask the student to write a function which draws the starting line. They can use the function which draws the finish line as a guide.
        - Ask the student to figure out where to call their new function which draws the starting line.
        - Ask the student to write a function which determines which turtle came in last place.
        - At the end of the program, write some code which calls the function to get the last place turtle and encourage that turtle to do better next time.
        - Write a function which accepts two turtles and determines the distance (along the X-axis) between them.
        - Write some code at the end to determine just how badly the first place turtle beat the last place turtle.
- Third Period After Lunch
    - Review how lists work.
    - Translate this to 2D lists.
    - Work on the ASCII art program, which uses 2D list library Numpy.
